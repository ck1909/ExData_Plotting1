## README

This repo contains plot1.R and plot1.png, ..., plot4.R and plot4.png.

The **main()** function in each .R file can be used to generate and save the plot to PNG, end-to-end.

Note that the file *household_power_consumption.txt* is not hardcoded into any of the functions. The file path can simply be given as an argument to the **main()** function.
